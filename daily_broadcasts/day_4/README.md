# Day 4 RGB Light

This script defines three LED lights of different colors: 
- Red
- Green
- Blue

And configure 3 different switches for 3 different tasks.
It could be as simple as:
- Each switch turns one LED light on OR
- Each switch activates different LED lights code (SOS, HELLO, etc.)
- Each switch turns all on/off, two on/off, etc.
